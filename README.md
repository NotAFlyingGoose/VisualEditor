# VisualEditor
So i was researching "blockly" by google and i thought to myself "that would be cool to make in java." so over the course of a few days i created
this visual editor.
The "Codons" are on the right and the editor is on the left.
currently nothing really happens when you put codons down or do anything really.

it is just a fun little project.
I may come back later to fix some bugs and add functionality to the codons
